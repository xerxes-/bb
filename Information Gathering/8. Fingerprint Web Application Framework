How to Test

There are several common locations to consider in order to identify frameworks or components:

HTTP headers
The most basic form of identifying a web framework is to look at the X-Powered-By field in the HTTP response header.
ex:
```
$ nc 127.0.0.1 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.0.14
[...]
X-Powered-By: Mono
```

X-Powered-By header can be disabled and not shown sometimes or obfuscated.

Cookies
ex: Cookie: CAKEPHP=sgdsgasdgb235dfsdge;

HTML source code

Specific files and folders
Use ffuf to discover files and thus, framework used.
Specific files and folders are different for each specific application. If the identified application or component is Open
Source there may be value in setting up a temporary installation during penetration tests in order to gain a better
understanding of what infrastructure or functionality is presented, and what files might be left on the server.
