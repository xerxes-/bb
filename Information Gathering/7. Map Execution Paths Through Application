How to Test

In black-box testing it is extremely difficult to test the entire codebase. Not just because the tester has no view of the
code paths through the application, but even if they did, to test all code paths would be very time consuming. One way
to reconcile this is to document what code paths were discovered and tested.

Reasonable way is
Data Flow (or Taint Analysis) - tests the assignment of variables via external interaction (normally users). Focuses
on mapping the flow, transformation and use of data throughout an application.

Automatic Spidering
It is a tool used to automatically discover new resources (URLs) on a particular website. 
It begins with a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is started.
Tools: Burp, katana
