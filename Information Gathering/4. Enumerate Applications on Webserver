How to Test

There are three factors influencing how many applications are related to a given DNS name (or an IP address):

1. Different Base URL
For example, the same symbolic name(http://www.example.com) may be associated to three web applications such as:
http://www.example.com/url1 http://www.example.com/url2 http://www.example.com/url3

Approach-
1. directory browsing
2. dork like site: www.example.com
3. bruteforce with ffuf

2. Non-standard Ports
ex: http://www.example.com:20000/

Approach-
Use Nmap

3. Virtual Hosts
DNS allows a single IP address to be associated with one or more symbolic names. 
For example, the IP address 192.168.1.100 might be associated to DNS names www.example.com , helpdesk.example.com , webmail.example.com. 
It is not necessary that all the names belong to the same DNS domain. 

This 1-to-N relationship may be reflected to serve different content by using so called virtual hosts. 

The information specifying the virtual host we are referring to is embedded in the HTTP 1.1 Host header, ex:
in http request, the Host header mentions the virtual host we are trying to access.

Approach-
There are a number of techniques which may be used to identify DNS names associated to a given IP address x.y.z.t

1. DNS Zone Transfers
This technique has limited use nowadays, given the fact that zone transfers are largely not honored by DNS servers.
However, it may be worth a try. 

First of all, testers must determine the name servers serving x.y.z.t . 
If a symbolic name is known for x.y.z.t (let it be www.example.com ), its name servers can be determined by means of tools such
as nslookup , host , or dig , by requesting DNS NS records.

Also, For example, if the target consists of the IP address x.y.z.t and the name mail.example.com ,
determine the name servers for domain example.com .


The following example shows how to identify the name servers for www.owasp.org by using the host command:
```
$ host -t ns www.owasp.org
www.owasp.org is an alias for owasp.org.
owasp.org name server ns1.secure.net.
owasp.org name server ns2.secure.net.
```

A zone transfer may now be requested to the name servers for domain example.com . 
If the tester is lucky, they will get back a list of the DNS entries for this domain. 
This will include the obvious www.example.com and the not-so-obvious helpdesk.example.com and webmail.example.com (and possibly others). 

Trying to request a zone transfer for owasp.org from one of its name servers:
```
$ host -l www.owasp.org ns1.secure.net
Using domain server:
Name: ns1.secure.net
Address: 192.220.124.10#53
Aliases:
Host www.owasp.org not found: 5(REFUSED)
; Transfer failed.
```

2. DNS Inverse Queries

This process is similar to the previous one, but relies on inverse (PTR) DNS records. Rather than requesting a zone
transfer, try setting the record type to PTR and issue a query on the given IP address. If the testers are lucky, they may
get back a DNS name entry. This technique relies on the existence of IP-to-symbolic name maps, which is not
guaranteed.

3. Vhost Fuzzing
