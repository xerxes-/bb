Identifying JavaScript Code and Gathering JavaScript Files

Identifying Source Map Files

Source map files will usually be loaded when DevTools open. 
Testers can also find source map files by adding the “.map” extension after the extension of each external JavaScript file. 
For example, if a tester sees a
/static/js/main.chunk.js file, they can then check for its source map file by visiting
/static/js/main.chunk.js.map
