Test Objectives

Identify what sensitive design and configuration information of the application, system, or organization is exposed
directly (on the organizationâ€™s website) or indirectly (via third-party services).

How to Test

Use a search engine to search for potentially sensitive information. This may include:

network diagrams and configurations;
archived posts and emails by administrators or other key staff;
logon procedures and username formats;
usernames, passwords, and private keys;
third-party, or cloud service configuration files;
revealing error message content; and
development, test, User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and staging versions of sites.

-

Do not limit testing to just one search engine provider, as different search engines may generate different results:

Bing
Baidu
Google
Duckduckgo
Shodan
Censys
Github
Internet Archive Wayback Machine
Startpage
Common Crawl

Dork on different search engines

A database of dorks, such as Google Hacking Database, is a useful resource that can help uncover specific
information. 
Some categories of dorks available on this database include:

Footholds
Files containing usernames
Sensitive Directories
Web Server Detection
Vulnerable Files
Vulnerable Servers
Error Messages
Files containing juicy info
Files containing passwords
Sensitive Online Shopping Info
