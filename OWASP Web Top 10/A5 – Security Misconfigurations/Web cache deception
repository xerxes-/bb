It is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a website into storing private or sensitive information in a public cache (like a CDN or proxy), which anyone can then access.

üîç Simple Example:

Imagine a website has a "My Account" page at:

https://example.com/account

This page is meant only for logged-in users, and should never be cached because it shows personal data.


Now the attacker tricks the site by visiting a fake URL like:

https://example.com/account/random.jpg

    The site still shows the account page, because it ignores the fake .jpg.

    The web cache sees .jpg and thinks it's a static file, so it stores the page.

    Now if anyone else visits that same URL, they see the attacker's account info!
