How to Test

1. Can anyone register for access?
2. Are registrations vetted by a human prior to provisioning, or are they automatically granted if the criteria are met?
3. Can the same person or identity register multiple times?
4. Can users register for different roles or permissions?
5. What proof of identity is required for a registration to be successful?
6. Are registered identities verified?

Validate the registration process:
1. Can identity information be easily forged or faked?
2. Can the exchange of identity information be manipulated during registration?

Example

In the WordPress, the only identification requirement is an email address that is accessible to the registrant.
In contrast, in the Google two can be verified (email address and mobile number), the identification requirements are stricter than WordPress.
