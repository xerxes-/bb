How to Test

In Linux, use ls command to check the file permissions. 
Alternatively, namei can also be used to recursively list file permissions.

$ namei -l /PathToCheck/

The files and directories that require file permission testing include but are not limited to:
Web files/directory
Configuration files/directory
Sensitive files (encrypted data, password, key)/directory
Log files (security logs, operation logs, admin logs)/directory
Executables (scripts, EXE, JAR, class, PHP, ASP)/directory
Database files/directory
Temp files /directory
Upload files/directory
