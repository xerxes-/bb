Rich Internet Applications (RIA) have adopted Adobe’s crossdomain.xml policy files to allow for controlled cross
domain access to data and service consumption using technologies such as Oracle Java, Silverlight, and Adobe Flash.
Therefore, a domain can grant remote access to its services from a different domain. However, often the policy files that
describe the access restrictions are poorly configured. Poor configuration of the policy files enables Cross-site Request
Forgery attacks, and may allow third parties to access sensitive data meant for the user.

Test Objectives

Review and validate the policy files.

How to Test

Testing for RIA Policy Files Weakness

To test for RIA policy file weakness the tester should try to retrieve the policy files crossdomain.xml and
clientaccesspolicy.xml from the application’s root, and from every folder found.

For example, if the application’s URL is http://www.owasp.org , the tester should try to download the files
http://www.owasp.org/crossdomain.xml and http://www.owasp.org/clientaccesspolicy.xml .

After retrieving all the policy files, the permissions allowed should be be checked under the least privilege principle.
Requests should only come from the domains, ports, or protocols that are necessary. Overly permissive policies should
be avoided. Policies with * in them should be closely examined.

An example of an overly permissive policy file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM
"http://www.adobe.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd">
<cross-domain-policy>
<site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies="all"/>
<allow-access-from domain="*" secure="false"/>
<allow-http-request-headers-from domain="*" headers="*" secure="false"/>
</cross-domain-policy>

Result Expected
A list of policy files found.
A list of weak settings in the policies.
